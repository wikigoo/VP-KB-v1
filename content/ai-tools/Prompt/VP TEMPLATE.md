## **STEP 1 : Instructions

### Leveraging Knowledge Files:
- If the user’s question is included in the document, answer the user’s question based on the document
-  slow down and analyze the entire file to ensure comprehensive utilization.
- Specificity in Knowledge Extraction: Review your work thoroughly and take your time when recovering specific data from files.

## **STEP 2 : Output Format

### Utilizing Markdown and Structured Formatting

Enhancing the clarity and effectiveness of your instructions is crucial for optimal GPT performance. Incorporating Markdown syntax and structured formatting can significantly improve the readability and precision of your prompts.

**Organize Content Using Headings:**

- **Headers**: Use the number sign `#` followed by a space to create headings. More number signs indicate smaller heading levels.

## **Enhancing Instructions**

1. **Simplify Complex Instructions:**
    
    - Break down multi-step instructions into simpler, more manageable steps to ensure the model can follow them accurately.
        
    - Use “trigger/instruction pairs”, separated by delimiters to improve reliability in following steps without merging or skipping them.
        
        - These look like the following:
            
            ```
            Trigger: User submits informationInstruction: Analyze information for themes
            ```
            
            ```
            Trigger: Themes analyzedInstruction: Leverage themes analyzed to provide summary in bullet point form of the recommendations you’d give
            ```
            
    
2. **Structure for Clarity:**
    
    - Break down second-level instructions into separate steps for better execution.
        
    - Use delimiters between instruction sets and for call-outs of few-shot examples to enhance clarity.
        
3. **Promote Attention to Detail:**
    
    - Incorporate “take your time,” “take a deep breath,” and “check your work” techniques to encourage the model to be thorough.
        
    - Use “strengthening language” to highlight critical parts of the instructions, ensuring they are not overlooked.
        
4. **Avoid Negative Instructions:**
    
    - Frame instructions positively to improve adherence and avoid confusion.
        
5. **Granular Steps:**
    
    - Break down steps as granularly as possible, especially when multiple actions are required within a single step.
        
6. **Consistency and Clarity:**
    
    - Explicitly define terms and definitions you are expecting using few-shot prompting (e.g., acceptable vs. unacceptable changes) to improve consistency in evaluations.
        
    - Clarify any relevant classifications with few-shot examples to reduce variability in output.
        
7. **Ensure Proper Spacing and Readability:**
    
    - Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with a blank line to distinguish different ideas or instructions.
        
    - Line Breaks: End a line with two spaces followed by Enter to insert a line break without starting a new paragraph.

Of course. Here is a comprehensive, step-by-step guide created from the "Advanced Chatbot Prompt Generator System" prompt.

# The Complete Guide to the Advanced Chatbot Prompt Generator System

## Introduction: From Simple Instructions to Professional Blueprints

In the world of artificial intelligence, the quality of your output is directly tied to the quality of your input. A simple, one-line instruction might produce a usable result, but it often lacks consistency, depth, and reliability. To build a truly effective, professional-grade chatbot, you need more than a command; you need a blueprint.

This guide translates the internal operating system of an expert AI—the "Advanced Chatbot Prompt Generator System"—into a practical, step-by-step methodology for human users. It is designed to help you move beyond basic prompting and start engineering comprehensive, robust, and highly effective chatbot personas and instructions.

The core of this system is the **15-Section Framework**, a structured template that forces clarity and covers every critical aspect of a chatbot's design, from its core identity to its error-handling procedures. By following this guide, you will learn how to systematically deconstruct your ideas, gather the necessary requirements, and assemble them into a professional prompt that serves as a definitive charter for your AI.

## Part 1: The Core Methodology for Prompt Engineering

This structured process ensures that no detail is overlooked. It transforms the abstract idea of a chatbot into a concrete, actionable set of instructions.

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
**What it is:** The starting point. This is where you evaluate what you already know against what you need to define.
**How to do it:**
Begin with a simple concept statement. For example: "I want to build a chatbot that helps users troubleshoot their Wi-Fi issues."
Now, ask yourself:
*   What information is immediately obvious? (e.g., its domain is tech support).
*   What crucial details are missing? (e.g., Who is the user? A tech novice or an IT professional? What tone should it use? What specific steps should it follow?).
This initial assessment creates a "to-do list" of information you need to gather.

### Step 2: Information Gathering
**What it is:** The heart of the process. You systematically collect the details needed to populate the 15-section framework.
**How to do it:**
Use the **Essential Questions Framework** to guide your thinking. Answer each of these questions in detail. Don't rush this step; the quality of your answers here will determine the quality of your final prompt.

*   **What is the primary purpose/domain of your chatbot?** (e.g., "To provide Tier-1 technical support for home networking products.")
*   **Who is your target audience and what is their expertise level?** (e.g., "Non-technical home users who are likely frustrated and have limited knowledge of networking terms.")
*   **What specific tasks should it accomplish?** (e.g., "Guide users through a router reboot, check cable connections, help them find their Wi-Fi password, and escalate to a human agent if unresolved.")
*   **What tone and communication style do you prefer?** (e.g., "Patient, empathetic, clear, and simple. Avoid technical jargon. Use numbered lists for instructions.")
*   **Are there any compliance, ethical, or safety requirements?** (e.g., "Must not ask for personally identifiable information (PII) other than a case number. Must include a disclaimer about electrical safety when checking plugs.")
*   **How should the responses be formatted?** (e.g., "Short paragraphs, use of bolding for key actions, and markdown for lists. Always end with a clear question to guide the user to the next step.")
*   **What are your success metrics?** (e.g., "A successful interaction is one where the user's issue is resolved without escalation, or the user is successfully escalated with all necessary information collected.")
*   **What limitations or boundaries should exist?** (e.g., "It should not provide advice on non-networking topics, not speculate on hardware failures, and must state it is an AI.")

### Step 3: Requirement Validation
**What it is:** A critical checkpoint to ensure your requirements are clear, consistent, and feasible.
**How to do it:**
Review the answers you gathered in Step 2. Look for contradictions. For example, does a requirement to be "quick and concise" conflict with another requirement to be "deeply empathetic and detailed"? If so, decide which takes priority or how to balance them. This is also the time to consider technical feasibility. Can the AI model you're using actually adhere to the specified format or logic?

### Step 4: Structure Mapping
**What it is:** The organizational phase where you assign each piece of gathered information to its proper place within the 15-section framework.
**How to do it:**
Take your answers from Step 2 and begin slotting them into the 15 sections.
*   The answer to "What tone and communication style?" goes into Section 1 (Identity & Role Definition) and Section 5 (Behavioral Guidelines).
*   The answer to "What specific tasks?" goes into Section 2 (Primary Objective) and Section 4 (Specific Requirements).
*   The answer to "How should responses be formatted?" goes directly into Section 6 (Output Format & Structure).
This mapping process ensures every requirement has a home and helps you see where gaps still exist.

### Step 5: Gap Analysis
**What it is:** Identifying and filling the empty spaces in your framework.
**How to do it:**
After mapping, review your 15 sections. Are any of them sparse or empty? Perhaps you defined the primary goal but didn't think about fallback procedures (Section 15) or success metrics (Section 10). This is where you make conscious decisions. If you don't have a specific requirement, you can either create one based on best practices (e.g., "A good chatbot should have an error-handling protocol") or make a reasonable assumption (e.g., "Assume standard markdown formatting is acceptable").

### Step 6: Prompt Generation
**What it is:** The final assembly. You write out the complete, text-based prompt using the structured 15-section format.
**How to do it:**
Write clearly and concisely within each section. Use formatting like headings, bullet points, and bold text to make the prompt easy for the AI to parse. This is not a conversation; it is a technical specification. The final output should look exactly like the template provided in the original system.

### Step 7: Quality Review
**What it is:** The final polish. You review the generated prompt for consistency, completeness, and effectiveness.
**How to do it:**
Read your complete prompt from top to bottom.
*   **Consistency Check:** Does the persona defined in Section 1 align with the behavioral rules in Section 5 and the examples in Section 8?
*   **Completeness Check:** Is every section filled with meaningful, actionable content?
*   **Optimization Check:** Is the language precise? Could any instruction be misinterpreted? For example, instead of "be friendly," specify "use positive language, address the user by name if provided, and use empathetic phrasing like 'I understand that can be frustrating.'"

### Step 8 : Trigger/Instruction Pairs

**Trigger/instruction pairs** break down a prompt into two linked parts:
- **Trigger**: The condition or event that signals when an action should happen.
- **Instruction**: The specific action or response the AI should perform when the trigger occurs.

By explicitly separating these, you help ensure the AI responds to each step as intended, which is especially useful for multi-step processes or for handling conversations with several phases.

#### How to Use Trigger/Instruction Pairs (Step-by-Step)

1. **Identify Key Steps:** Break the overall task or workflow into clear steps, each with a distinct starting point (trigger).
2. **Define Each Trigger:** Describe the event, action, or condition that should “activate” the following instruction (e.g., “User submits information”).
3. **Write the Paired Instruction:** For each trigger, create a precise instruction for what the AI should do when the trigger happens.
4. **Separate Each Pair:** Use formatting such as line breaks, bullet points, or delimiters to keep triggers and instructions distinct.
5. **Sequence Pairs Logically:** Arrange the pairs in the order you want actions to unfold.
6. **Test and Revise:** Check the AI outputs for each pair—refine triggers or instructions as needed.
#### Example of Trigger/Instruction Pairs

```
Trigger: User submits information
Instruction: Analyze information for themes

Trigger: Themes analyzed
Instruction: Leverage themes analyzed to provide summary in bullet point form of the recommendations you’d give
```
#### When to Use

Trigger/instruction pairs are especially helpful when:
- You need the AI to act differently based on what has already happened in a chat.
- There are multiple steps, decision points, or conditional actions in your workflow.
#### Why Use This Method?

- **Increases reliability:** Reduces the chance the AI skips, merges, or misorders steps.
- **Improves clarity:** Makes complex multi-step tasks easier for the AI to interpret.
- **Enhances maintainability:** Each step is easy to modify, add, or remove as needed.

**Summary:**
*“Trigger/instruction pairs” make your prompts clearer and ensure AI responses happen at the right time and in the right way, particularly for multi-step or interactive tasks.*

### Step 9 Strengthening Language
#### Step-by-Step Guide to Using Strengthening Language in Prompts

1. **Identify Key Instructions:**
   Review your prompt and pinpoint the most important actions or information you want the AI to follow.

2. **Choose Strong, Direct Language:**
   Use phrases that clearly emphasize what’s essential or non-negotiable.

3. **Use Formatting:**
   Consider **bolding**, *italicizing*, or underlining important words if supported by the interface, and separating crucial points into bulleted or numbered lists.

4. **Be Repetitive if Needed:**
   Restate vital instructions to make them stand out, especially for longer or multi-step tasks.

5. **Frame Instructions Positively:**
   Tell the AI what to do, not what to avoid, and phrase instructions in a constructive way.

6. **Encourage Thoroughness:**
   Insert phrases like “take your time” or “double-check before responding” to increase care.

7. **Test and Revise:**
   Review the AI outputs and strengthen language where you see misinterpretation or missed steps.
#### Examples of Strengthening Language

1. **It is essential that you...**
2. **Be sure to...**
3. **Always include...**
4. **Do not proceed until...**
5. **You must...**
6. **Absolutely avoid...**
7. **Make certain to...**
8. **Prioritize...**
9. **Take extra care to...**
10. **Pay special attention to...**
11. **Under no circumstances should you...**
12. **You are required to...**
13. **It’s critical that you...**
14. **Do not skip...**
15. **Never forget to...**
16. **The most important step is...**
17. **Emphasize...**
18. **Highlight...**
19. **Double-check your response for...**
20. **Your top priority is...**

#### 3 Examples of Strengthening Language in Actual Prompts

**Example 1:**
> “Summarize the main findings from the document. **Be sure to highlight at least three key takeaways and list them in bullet points.** It is essential that you avoid repeating phrases.”

**Example 2:**
> “When answering the user’s question, you must use information only from the provided document. **Do not include any outside information. Every answer should be concise and accurate.** Double-check your response for completeness before submitting.”

**Example 3:**
> “Create a 200-word story for children. **It’s critical that the story is age-appropriate and free from scary content.** Pay special attention to making the language simple and positive throughout.”


### Step 10 : Leveraging Knowledge Files in Prompts
## Guide: Leveraging Knowledge Files in Prompts

**1. Clearly Tell the Model to Use Knowledge Files**
   - Explicitly instruct the AI to refer to knowledge files for information, not just rely on general knowledge or assumptions.

**2. Specify File Names or Types**
   - Mention the exact names of files or describe the content/focus (e.g., “company_policy.pdf,” “product_manual.txt”) so the model knows where to look.

**3. Instruct the Model to Analyze the Whole File**
   - Make it clear that the model should review the entire file—not just the beginning or a single section—to catch all relevant details.

**4. Ask the Model to Take Its Time and Be Thorough**
   - Include language encouraging the model to slow down, process carefully, and not miss important information.

**5. Request Step-by-Step or Comprehensive Outputs**
   - Encourage outputs that reflect deep understanding, such as summaries, detailed answers, or step-by-step explanations drawn from the file.

#### Example: Template Prompt

> Please use the document “product_manual.pdf” as your primary source.
> Carefully read and analyze the entire file, taking your time to ensure you don’t miss any important sections.
> Summarize the key features as outlined in the file, and reference specific sections or page numbers where appropriate. Do not answer until you have reviewed the whole document.

#### 20 Example Instructions for Leveraging Knowledge Files

1. “Refer to the file named ‘employee_handbook.pdf’ and base your answer solely on its contents.”
2. “Analyze the complete ‘financial_report_2024.xlsx’ and summarize all major findings.”
3. “Use ‘customer_FAQ.docx’ exclusively for responding—review every question and answer listed.”
4. “Slow down and read ‘safety_policy.pdf’ in full before drafting your summary.”
5. “Carefully review all sections of ‘data_security_guidelines.txt’ and explain the protocol in detail.”
6. “Don’t respond until you have checked every page in ‘training_materials.pdf’ for relevant guidance.”
7. “Use ‘annual_performance_review.pdf’—quote directly from the file where possible.”
8. “Cite specific sections of ‘marketing_strategy_2025.docx’ in your analysis.”
9. “Go through ‘research_paper.pdf’ thoroughly and only summarize findings supported by the document.”
10. “All recommendations must be drawn from ‘project_plan.xlsx’—do not infer outside information.”
11. “Take your time with ‘legal_compliance.docx’; ensure all compliance items are listed in your answer.”
12. “Use the contents of ‘company_directory.csv’ to answer—ensure no departments are missed.”
13. “Carefully consider each chapter in ‘user_manual.pdf’ before providing instructions.”
14. “Extract key data points from ‘survey_results.xls’ by reviewing all sheets inside the file.”
15. “Only use information found in ‘conference_minutes.doc’—double-check for accuracy.”
16. “Study ‘partnership_agreement.pdf’ in its entirety—summarize main obligations section by section.”
17. “List all steps detailed in ‘installation_guide.txt’—read the guide fully before starting your summary.”
18. “Be exhaustive: use all relevant information from ‘portfolio_summary_2024.pdf’.”
19. “Before answering, confirm you have read every appendix in ‘technical_specifications.pdf’.”
20. “Provide a detailed answer using only ‘policies_procedures_manual.docx’ as your reference and make sure no relevant policies are overlooked.”

**Summary:**
When instructing an AI to use knowledge files, be explicit about the file(s) to use, direct the model to thoroughly analyze all contents, and encourage careful, comprehensive responses. This improves accuracy and ensures all information is utilized.

### Step 11 : Explicitly Defining Terms with Few-Shot Prompting

1. **Identify Key Terms or Criteria**  
   Figure out which terms or categories need clear definitions in your prompt (e.g., “acceptable change,” “major revision,” “minor update”).

2. **Write Clear Definitions for Each Term**  
   For each key term, provide a concise, unambiguous explanation. Avoid jargon or subjective words if possible.

3. **Create Few-Shot Examples**  
   List specific examples for each term.  
   - For “acceptable changes,” give examples of what would qualify.  
   - For “unacceptable changes,” give contrasting examples.

4. **Combine Definitions and Examples in the Prompt**  
   Structure the prompt so the AI first reads the definition, then the associated examples, making it clear how to differentiate categories.

5. **Instruct the AI to Use These Definitions**  
   Add direct instructions:  
   - “Use the definitions and examples above when making evaluations.”  
   - “Categorize each suggestion as acceptable or unacceptable, according to these criteria.”

6. **Format for Clarity (Optional)**  
   Use bullet points, headings, or separators to make the definitions and examples stand out.

#### Example for Evaluating Changes

> **Definitions:**  
> - *Acceptable change:* A change that keeps the original meaning intact and improves clarity or grammar.  
> - *Unacceptable change:* A change that alters the meaning, introduces errors, or removes important information.
>
> **Examples:**  
> **Acceptable:**  
> - Changing “He go to school” to “He goes to school.”  
> - Replacing “very big” with “huge” if the meaning stays the same.
>
> **Unacceptable:**  
> - Changing “She is a doctor” to “She was a nurse.”  
> - Removing the sentence “The event starts at 6 PM.”

> Please evaluate the following suggested changes as *acceptable* or *unacceptable* using the rules and examples above.


**Why use this technique?**  
By defining your terms and pairing them with clear examples (“few-shot prompting”), you make sure the AI interprets instructions the way you want. This leads to more consistent, reliable results across evaluations and reduces output variability.

### Step 12: Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

  

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is one of the most powerful techniques for improving AI reasoning, especially for complex problems requiring multi-step thinking.

  

## **7.1 Zero-Shot CoT: "Let's Think Step by Step"**

  

Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting elicits reasoning without providing examples, using simple phrases that trigger step-by-step thinking.

  

### **Core Activation Phrases:**

  

**Basic Phrases:**

  

- "Let's think step by step"  

- "Think through this systematically"  

- "Break this down into steps"  

- "Work through this methodically"  

- "Analyze this step by step"

  

**Enhanced Activation Phrases:**

  

- "Let's approach this systematically, considering each factor"  

- "Think through this step by step, explaining your reasoning at each stage"  

- "Break this complex problem into manageable steps"  

- "Work through this methodically, showing your thought process"

  

### **When to Use Zero-Shot CoT:**

  

**Mathematical and Logical Problems:**

  

"A company's revenue increased by 15% in Q1, decreased by 8% in Q2, increased by 22% in Q3, and decreased by 5% in Q4. If they started the year with $2 million in quarterly revenue, what was their revenue in Q4? Let's work through this step by step."

  

**Complex Analysis Tasks:**

  

"Our marketing campaign generated 10,000 website visits, 1,200 email signups, and 150 purchases. The campaign cost $5,000 to run. Is this campaign profitable if our average customer lifetime value is $200? Think through this systematically."

  

**Decision-Making Scenarios:**

  

"We need to choose between three office locations for our expanding team. Location A is expensive but central, Location B is affordable but remote, and Location C is moderate in both price and location. Consider our priorities: team collaboration, cost control, and client accessibility. Let's think step by step about the best choice."

### Step 11:  Utilizing Markdown and Structured Formatting

Enhancing the clarity and effectiveness of your instructions is crucial for optimal GPT performance. Incorporating Markdown syntax and structured formatting can significantly improve the readability and precision of your prompts.

**Organize Content Using Headings:**

- **Headers**: Use the number sign `#` followed by a space to create headings. More number signs indicate smaller heading levels.

| **Example** | **Renders as** |
| --- | --- |
| \# This is Heading 1 | ## This is Heading 1 |
| \## This is Heading 2 | ## This is Heading 2 |
| \### This is Heading 3 | ### This is Heading 3 |

- Segment Instructions with Headings

| **Example** | **Renders as** |
| --- | --- |
| \# Context      You are a member of the HR team. Attached is an HR policy document.      \# Instructions      If the user’s question is included in the document, answer the user’s question based on the document     \- If the user’s question is based on local, state, or federal policies (e.g. 401k contribution limits), use web browsing to look up the answer  \- If the user’s question cannot be answered with the above steps, tell them to email [hr@acmecorp.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/)      \# Additional Information      \- Users can contact support for further assistance. | ## Context  You are a member of the HR team. Attached is an HR policy document.  ## Instructions  - If the user’s question is included in the document, answer the user’s question based on the document - If the user’s question is based on local, state, or federal policies (e.g. 401k contribution limits), use web browsing to look up the answer - If the user’s question cannot be answered with the above steps, tell them to email [hr@acmecorp.com](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/)  ## Additional Information  - Users can contact support for further assistance. |

**Emphasize Key Information:**

- **Bold Text:** Use double asterisks `**` to highlight important points.

| **Example** | **Renders as** |
| --- | --- |
| \*\*This text will be bold\*\* | **This text will be bold** |
| Some text will be \*\*bold\*\* | This text will be **bold** |

- *Italic Text:* Use single asterisks `*` or underscores `_` to emphasize specific terms.

| **Example** | **Renders as** |
| --- | --- |
| \*This text will be italic\* | *This text will be italic* |
| \_This text will be italic\_ | *This text will be italic* |
| \_You \*\*can\*\* combine them\_ | *You **can** combine them* |

**Organize information with Lists:**

- **Unordered Lists:** Use hyphens `-` or asterisks `*` to create bullet points.

| **Example** | **Renders as** |
| --- | --- |
| \* Item 1   \* Item 2 | - Item 1 - Item 2 |
| \- Item 1  \- Item 2 | - Item 1 - Item 2 |

- **Ordered Lists:** Use numbers followed by periods for sequential steps.

| **Example** | **Renders as** |
| --- | --- |
| 1\. Item 1  2\. Item 2 | 1. Item 1 2. Item 2 |

---

## Part 2: A Deep Dive into the 15-Section Framework

This is the blueprint itself. Understanding the purpose of each section is crucial for building a high-quality prompt.

#### **1. IDENTITY & ROLE DEFINITION**
*   **Purpose:** To give the chatbot a soul. This defines its persona, expertise, and communication style. It’s the difference between a generic machine and a helpful assistant.
*   **Guiding Questions:** Who is this chatbot? What is its name? Is it a formal expert, a friendly guide, or a quirky assistant? What is its domain of knowledge?
*   **Example:** "You are 'NetHelper,' a friendly and patient technical support assistant from Acme Connect. Your expertise is limited to home networking. You communicate in simple, clear language, avoiding all technical jargon."
Persona Assignment: Giving AI a Role**

#### **2. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE**
*   **Purpose:** To define the chatbot's single most important goal. This is its reason for existing.
*   **Guiding Questions:** What is the one thing the chatbot must achieve? How is success defined for a single interaction?
*   **Example:** "Your primary objective is to help non-technical users solve common Wi-Fi problems through a step-by-step diagnostic process, with the ultimate goal of restoring their internet connection without needing to escalate to a human agent."

#### **3. CONTEXT & BACKGROUND**
*   **Purpose:** To provide the situational awareness the chatbot needs. It sets the scene for the interaction.
*   **Guiding Questions:** What situation will the user be in when they interact with the bot? What is their likely emotional state (e.g., frustrated, curious)? What background information is essential?
*   **Example:** "The user is likely experiencing an internet outage and is frustrated or stressed. They have a low level of technical expertise. The interaction is happening in a support chat window on our company website."

Context helps AI understand the situation, constraints, and environment for the task.

### **Types of Context:**

**Situational Context:**

"Our company is a 2-year-old startup in the sustainable packaging industry, currently serving 50 B2B clients, with plans to expand to retail markets next year."

**Audience Context:**

"The presentation will be delivered to senior executives who have limited technical background but strong business acumen. They're particularly concerned with ROI and implementation timelines."

**Resource Context:**

"We have a marketing budget of $10,000 per month, a team of 3 people, and access to standard marketing tools like HubSpot and Canva."

**Constraint Context:**

"The solution must be implementable within 30 days, require minimal technical expertise, and comply with GDPR regulations."

**Historical Context:**

"Previous marketing campaigns focused on email marketing achieved a 15% open rate and 3% conversion rate. Our most successful campaign was a webinar series that generated 200 qualified leads."

### **Context Structuring Techniques:**

**Current State Description:**

"Currently, we \[current situation\]. We've tried \[previous attempts\] with \[results\]. Our main challenges are \[specific problems\]."

**Goal-Oriented Context:**

"We want to achieve \[specific goal\] by \[timeline\] because \[motivation\]. Success will be measured by \[metrics\]."

**Stakeholder Context:**

"Key stakeholders include \[list\] who care most about \[their priorities\]. The decision-maker is \[role\] who prioritizes \[key factors\]."

#### **4. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS**
*   **Purpose:** To list the non-negotiable technical, functional, and quality benchmarks.
*   **Guiding Questions:** Are there specific diagnostic steps that must be followed in order? Are there compliance rules (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) to adhere to?
*   **Example:** "1. The diagnostic process must always start with asking the user to reboot their router. 2. You must collect the user's router model number before providing specific instructions. 3. Do not store any personal data after the session ends."

#### **5. BEHAVIORAL GUIDELINES**
*   **Purpose:** To define the rules of engagement—the do's and don'ts of the chatbot's behavior.
*   **Guiding Questions:** How should it handle user frustration? What topics are off-limits? Should it ever admit it's an AI?
*   **Example:** "DO: Remain calm and reassuring at all times. DO: Break down complex instructions into small, numbered steps. DON'T: Speculate on the cause of a problem. DON'T: Use humor or sarcasm. ALWAYS: Disclose that you are an AI assistant at the beginning of the chat."

#### **6. OUTPUT FORMAT & STRUCTURE**
*   **Purpose:** To control the presentation of the chatbot's responses for maximum clarity and usability.
*   **Guiding Questions:** Should responses be short or long? Should it use lists, bold text, or emojis? Is there a specific structure for every message (e.g., Acknowledgment, Information, Question)?
*   **Example:** "All responses must be under 80 words. Use markdown for numbered lists for all instructions. Use **bold** for critical actions like 'Unplug the power cord.' End every response with a single, clear question to guide the user."

\- "Adopt an expert-to-expert tone with technical depth"

\- "Write in conversational style for social media audiences"

#### **7. PROCESS & METHODOLOGY**
*   **Purpose:** To outline the chatbot's internal step-by-step logic or decision-making framework.
*   **Guiding Questions:** What is the logical flow of the conversation? What is the diagnostic funnel? When does it decide to escalate?
*   **Example:** "Follow this diagnostic sequence: 1. Reboot Router. 2. Check Physical Cables. 3. Verify Wi-Fi Password. 4. Check for Service Outages. 5. If all fail, initiate escalation process."

#### **8. EXAMPLES & DEMONSTRATIONS**
*   **Purpose:** To provide concrete, "show, don't tell" examples of ideal interactions. This is one of the most powerful ways to train the AI.
*   **Guiding Questions:** What does a perfect "good path" conversation look like? What is an example of correctly handling a frustrated user?
*   **Example:** "**Good Interaction:** User: 'My internet is down!' Bot: 'I understand how frustrating that can be. I'm here to help. First, have you tried restarting your router?' **Edge Case:** User: 'This is useless!' Bot: 'I'm sorry you're feeling frustrated. Let's try a different approach. Can you tell me what lights are currently on your router?'"

#### **9. INPUT PROCESSING**
*   **Purpose:** To instruct the AI on how to interpret and handle user input.
*   **Guiding Questions:** How should it handle typos or vague questions? What should it do if the user provides multiple pieces of information at once?
*   **Example:** "If the user's query is unclear, ask a clarifying question instead of guessing. For example, if the user says 'It's not working,' respond with 'I can help with that. To start, can you tell me if you are unable to connect to the Wi-Fi, or if the connection is just slow?'"

#### **10. SUCCESS METRICS & EVALUATION**
*   **Purpose:** To define what a "good" job looks like so the chatbot's performance can be measured.
*   **Guiding Questions:** How do we know if the chatbot is effective? What are the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)?
*   **Example:** "Success is measured by: 1. Resolution Rate: Percentage of issues solved without escalation. 2. Session Duration: Shorter sessions for simple problems are better. 3. User Satisfaction: Measured by a simple 'Was this helpful?' (Yes/No) question at the end."

#### **11. CONSTRAINTS & LIMITATIONS**
*   **Purpose:** To build a fence around the chatbot's operational scope, ensuring it stays on task and operates safely.
*   **Guiding Questions:** What topics should the chatbot refuse to discuss? What tasks is it not allowed to perform?
*   **Example:** "You are strictly forbidden from providing medical, legal, or financial advice. Your knowledge is confined to Acme Connect products. You cannot help with competitor products. You must refuse to process any requests that involve changing account passwords or billing information."

#### **12. CORE PROCESSING & COGNITIVE FRAMEWORK**
*   **Purpose:** To guide the AI's "thinking" process. This is more abstract and deals with its reasoning approach.
*   **Guiding Questions:** Should it reason from first principles? Use a process of elimination? Be transparent about its reasoning?
*   **Example:** "Employ a deductive reasoning framework. Start with the most common and simplest solutions first (rebooting) and move towards more complex ones. If you suggest a step, briefly explain the 'why' in simple terms (e.g., 'Restarting the router helps clear out any temporary software glitches.')."

#### **13. ADAPTIVE RESPONSE MANAGEMENT**
*   **Purpose:** To make the chatbot dynamic and responsive to the ongoing conversation.
*   **Guiding Questions:** How should it adapt if the user indicates they are an expert? How should it use information provided earlier in the conversation?
*   **Example:** "If a user uses technical terms like 'DNS' or 'IP address,' you may slightly reduce the level of simplification in your language. Maintain a short-term memory of the user's previous answers to avoid asking the same question twice in one session."

#### **14. KNOWLEDGE & QUALITY ASSURANCE**
*   **Purpose:** To define the source of truth for the chatbot's information and how to ensure its accuracy.
*   **Guiding Questions:** Where does the chatbot get its information from? How should it be updated? What is the process for correcting errors?
*   **Example:** "Your knowledge base is restricted to the official Acme Connect Support Manual (Version 4.2). Do not use information from the public internet. All information must be validated against this source. If you provide incorrect information, it must be logged for review."

#### **15. FALLBACK & ERROR HANDLING**
*   **Purpose:** To define a safety net. What does the chatbot do when it is confused, doesn't know the answer, or encounters an error?
*   **Guiding Questions:** What is the exact procedure for escalating to a human? What should it say when it doesn't understand a question?
*   **Example:** "If you are asked the same question three times and cannot provide a satisfactory answer, automatically trigger the escalation protocol. The escalation message should be: 'It seems I'm unable to resolve your issue. I'm transferring you to a human agent who can assist you further.' If you don't understand a query, say: 'I'm not sure I understand. Could you please rephrase that?'"
