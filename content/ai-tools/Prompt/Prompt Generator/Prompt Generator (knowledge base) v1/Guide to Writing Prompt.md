# Step-by-Step Guide to Writing Complete Instruction Prompts

## Purpose

This guide shows you how to write comprehensive instruction prompts for professional chatbots. These prompts are detailed (typically 600-800 words) and contain ALL instructions directly in the prompt‚Äîunlike creative content prompts where complexity lives in external files.

---

## OVERVIEW: Two Approaches to Prompts

**Creative Content Approach (150-200 words):**

- Short main prompt
- Complexity in knowledge base files
- Chatbot reads files first, then executes

**Complete Instruction Approach (1000-2000 words):**

- Everything in one prompt
- No external file dependencies
- Self-contained instructions
- **This guide covers THIS approach**

---

## Step 1: Define Purpose & Gather Requirements (15 minutes)

### 1.1 Complete the Purpose Statement

Fill in this template in 25 words or less:

> "This chatbot exists to **[primary action]** for **[target users]** so that **[desired outcome]**."

**Examples:**

- ‚úÖ "This chatbot exists to debug Python code for junior developers so that they can resolve errors independently."
- ‚úÖ "This chatbot exists to answer customer service questions for online shoppers so that they can complete purchases without human support."
- ‚ùå "This chatbot helps people." (Too vague)

### 1.2 Answer the 10 Essential Questions

Write down answers to these:

1. **Primary task**: What is the #1 thing it does?
2. **User input**: What will users typically ask/provide?
3. **Success metric**: How do you measure success?
4. **Tone**: Formal, casual, or somewhere between?
5. **Response length**: Short answers or detailed explanations?
6. **Constraints**: What should it never do or say?
7. **Data needs**: What information must it access?
8. **Format**: Bullet points, paragraphs, structured responses?
9. **Edge cases**: What are the 3 trickiest scenarios?
10. **Escalation**: When does a human need to take over?

### 1.3 Identify Your User

Document:

- **Expertise level**: Novice / Intermediate / Expert
- **Domain knowledge**: Technical background or general public?
- **Communication style**: Prefers formal or conversational tone?
- **Common scenarios**: List 3-5 typical use cases

**Validation checkpoint:**

- [ ] Purpose is specific and measurable
- [ ] All 10 questions answered
- [ ] User profile documented
- [ ] Success criteria defined

---

## Step 2: Write Identity & Role Definition (15 minutes)

### 2.1 Create the Header

Start with this format:

```markdown
# üß† [Chatbot Name / Purpose] ‚Äì Complete Instruction Template
```

**Examples:**

- `# üß† Python Code Debugger ‚Äì Complete Instruction Template`
- `# üß† Customer Service Assistant ‚Äì Complete Instruction Template`
- `# üß† Financial Advice Chatbot ‚Äì Complete Instruction Template`

### 2.2 Choose Your Role Framework

Pick one structure based on your chatbot type:

**Option A: Expert Professional** (for specialized domains)

```markdown
## 1. IDENTITY & ROLE DEFINITION

**Role:** Expert [specific title] for [target audience] created by [organization]

You specialize in [domain] and communicate in a [tone] manner.
Current model: [model_name] (model string: [model_string])
```

**Example:**

```markdown
**Role:** Expert Python Debugger for junior developers created by CodeHelp Inc.

You specialize in identifying and fixing Python errors and communicate in a patient, educational manner.
Current model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (model string: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
```

**Option B: Service Role** (for customer support)

```markdown
**Role:** [Service role] for [company/organization]

You help users with [specific services] using a [approach] approach.
```

**Example:**

```markdown
**Role:** Customer Service Representative for TechStore

You help users with order tracking, returns, and product questions using a friendly, solution-focused approach.
```

**Option C: Specialized Assistant** (for task-specific bots)

```markdown
**Role:** Specialized assistant designed to [primary function]

You help users by [specific methods] and prioritize [key values].
```

### 2.3 Define Communication Style

Add a style matrix with specific examples:

```markdown
**Communication Style:**
- **Formality**: [Highly Formal / Professional / Conversational / Casual]
- **Tone**: [Authoritative / Collaborative / Empathetic / Direct]
- **Pacing**: [Concise / Balanced / Thorough]
- **Language**: [Technical / Plain / Mixed based on user]
```

Include 2-3 sample phrases for your chosen style:

**Examples:**

- Professional: "I'll help you resolve this issue."
- Conversational: "Let's figure this out together."
- Casual: "No worries‚ÄîI've got you covered."

**Validation checkpoint:**

- [ ] Role clearly defined
- [ ] Target audience specified
- [ ] Communication style documented with examples
- [ ] Model information included if relevant

---

## Step 3: Write Primary Objective & Context (20 minutes)

### 3.1 Create the Objective Statement

Write one clear sentence describing what the chatbot does:

```markdown
## 2. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

**Goal:** Generate [output type] by [specific method]

Success = [measurable outcome]
```

**Examples:**

- "**Goal:** Debug Python code by analyzing errors, identifying root causes, and suggesting fixes. Success = User can resolve error independently."
- "**Goal:** Answer customer service questions by accessing order database and company policies. Success = Customer gets accurate answer in <2 minutes."

### 3.2 Add Context Requirements

Use this XML structure for comprehensive context:

```markdown
<context>
- **Purpose:** {{PURPOSE_OF_TASK}}
- **Target audience:** {{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}
- **User knowledge level:** [novice/intermediate/expert]
- **Constraints:** [time, policy, confidentiality, format requirements]
- **Success criteria:** {{SUCCESS_CRITERIA}}
</context>
```

**Customization:** Replace {{variables}} with your specific information. Keep it under 100 words.

**Example:**

```markdown
<context>
- **Purpose:** Help users debug Python errors quickly
- **Target audience:** Junior developers (1-3 years experience)
- **User knowledge level:** Intermediate (knows syntax, limited debugging experience)
- **Constraints:** Cannot execute code, must explain concepts simply, 5-minute response time target
- **Success criteria:** User understands the error and knows how to fix it
</context>
```

**Validation checkpoint:**

- [ ] Objective is one clear sentence
- [ ] Success criteria is measurable
- [ ] Context includes all required elements
- [ ] Variables replaced with specifics

---

## Step 4: Design Mandatory Process & Workflow (30 minutes)

### 4.1 Write Sequential Steps

Create 5-10 numbered steps that must be followed:

```markdown
## 3. MANDATORY PROCESS & WORKFLOW

**ALWAYS follow this exact sequence:**

<instructions>
1. [First action]
2. [Second action]
3. [Third action]
4. [Fourth action]
5. [Fifth action]
6. [Verification step]
</instructions>
```

**Make steps specific and actionable:**

‚ùå Bad: "Understand the user's request" ‚úÖ Good: "Extract the error message, code snippet, and user's attempted solution"

‚ùå Bad: "Provide a solution" ‚úÖ Good: "Explain the root cause in plain language, show the fix with code example, and verify user understands"

### 4.2 Add the Golden Rule

Include this critical reminder:

```markdown
**Golden Rule:** Show this prompt to a colleague with minimal context‚Äîif they're confused, Claude will be too.
```

### 4.3 Create Process Example

Show one complete workflow:

**Example for Python Debugger:**

```markdown
**Example Process:**
User provides: "NameError: name 'user_input' is not defined"

1. **Identify error type:** NameError = variable not defined
2. **Analyze context:** Check if variable is misspelled, not initialized, or out of scope
3. **Determine cause:** Variable likely used before being assigned
4. **Explain clearly:** "This means Python can't find a variable named 'user_input'"
5. **Provide fix:** Show correct initialization: `user_input = input("Enter value: ")`
6. **Verify understanding:** "Does this make sense? Do you see where to add this line?"
```

**Validation checkpoint:**

- [ ] 5-10 clear, sequential steps
- [ ] Each step is specific and actionable
- [ ] Golden Rule included
- [ ] Example workflow provided

---

## Step 5: Establish Critical Rules (20 minutes)

### 5.1 Write Non-Negotiable Rules

Create 10-15 rules in three categories:

```markdown
## 4. CRITICAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Core Behavior Rules:
- ‚õî **Never [prohibited action]**
- ‚õî **Never [prohibited action]**
- ‚úÖ **Always [required action]**
- ‚úÖ **Always [required action]**

### Content-Specific Rules:
- **[Rule specific to your domain]**
- **[Rule specific to your domain]**
- **[Rule specific to your domain]**

### Error Handling Rules:
- **[How to handle uncertainty]**
- **[How to handle missing information]**
- **[When to escalate]**
```

**Use explicit, unambiguous language:**

‚úÖ Good rules:

- "Never execute or run code‚Äîonly analyze and suggest fixes"
- "Always explain the 'why' behind the error, not just the 'how' to fix it"
- "If the error is unclear, ask for the full traceback before suggesting solutions"

‚ùå Bad rules:

- "Be helpful" (too vague)
- "Follow best practices" (what practices?)
- "Handle errors appropriately" (how?)

### 5.2 Add Reasoning for Key Rules

For critical rules, explain WHY:

**Example:**

```markdown
- **Never provide code without explanation**
  *(Why: Users need to understand the fix to learn and handle similar issues independently)*
  
- **Always ask for the full error traceback if initial message is unclear**
  *(Why: Root cause often appears earlier in the traceback, not in the final line)*
```

**Validation checkpoint:**

- [ ] 10-15 specific rules written
- [ ] Rules use explicit language (never/always)
- [ ] Organized into logical categories
- [ ] Key rules include reasoning

---

## Step 6: Define Input Processing (15 minutes)

### 6.1 Specify Input Format

Choose and document your input structure:

**Option A: Simple Single Input**

```markdown
## 5. INPUT PROCESSING

<input_data>
{{USER_INPUT}}
</input_data>

**Processing Rules:**
1. Validate input completeness
2. Extract key information: [list what to extract]
3. If ambiguous, ask clarifying questions
4. Never assume missing information
```

**Option B: Structured Multiple Inputs**

```markdown
<input_requirements>
- **Required:** [Field 1], [Field 2], [Field 3]
- **Optional:** [Field 4], [Field 5]
- **Format:** [Expected format]
</input_requirements>

**If input is incomplete:**
"I need [missing information] to help you effectively. Please provide [specific request]."
```

### 6.2 Add Input Validation

Define what makes inputs valid or invalid:

**Example:**

```markdown
**Valid inputs:**
‚úÖ Error message + code snippet
‚úÖ Error message + description of what user tried
‚úÖ Full traceback

**Invalid/Incomplete inputs:**
‚ùå Just "my code doesn't work" (too vague)
‚ùå Code without error message (can't diagnose)
‚ùå Error message without context (insufficient information)

**Response to invalid input:**
"To help debug this, I need:
1. The exact error message
2. The relevant code snippet
3. What you've already tried

Could you provide these details?"
```

**Validation checkpoint:**

- [ ] Input format clearly specified
- [ ] Validation rules defined
- [ ] Response to invalid input written
- [ ] Examples provided

---

## Step 7: Design Output Requirements (25 minutes)

### 7.1 Specify Output Structure

Define exact formatting requirements:

```markdown
## 6. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS & STRUCTURE

<output_requirements>
- **Format:** [Markdown / Plain text / Structured data]
- **Length:** [Target word count or range]
- **Tone:** [Formal / Professional / Conversational]
- **Include:** [Required elements]
- **Exclude:** [Forbidden elements]
</output_requirements>
```

### 7.2 Create Output Template

Show the exact structure responses should follow:

````markdown
### Output Structure Template:

## [Topic/Issue]

**Problem Identified:**
[1-2 sentence explanation of the error]

**Root Cause:**
[Plain language explanation of why this happened]

**Solution:**
```python
[Code fix with comments]
````

**Explanation:** [Step-by-step walkthrough of the fix]

**Verification:** [How user can confirm it works]

**Next Steps:** [Optional: Related concepts to learn]

````

### 7.3 Add Formatting Standards

```markdown
**Formatting Rules:**
- Use `#` for main headings
- Use `**bold**` for key terms
- Use code blocks with language tags: ```python
- Use bullet points for lists (max 5 items)
- Separate sections with blank lines
- Keep paragraphs under 4 lines
````

### 7.4 Provide Output Examples

Show 1-2 complete examples following your template:

**Example output included in prompt:**

````markdown
**Example Response:**

## NameError: Variable Not Defined

**Problem Identified:**
Python cannot find a variable named 'user_input' because it hasn't been created yet.

**Root Cause:**
You're trying to use `user_input` on line 5, but it's not defined until line 8. Python reads code top-to-bottom.

**Solution:**
```python
# Move the input() function BEFORE you use the variable
user_input = input("Enter your name: ")  # Define it first
print(f"Hello, {user_input}!")  # Now you can use it
````

**Explanation:**

1. Variables must be created before use
2. Move the input() line above where you use the variable
3. Python will now find 'user_input' when it reaches line 2

**Verification:** Run the code‚Äîyou should see the prompt, and no more NameError.

````

**Validation checkpoint:**
- [ ] Output format specified
- [ ] Structure template provided
- [ ] Formatting rules defined
- [ ] Complete example included

## Step 8: Add Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (20 minutes)

### 8.1 Insert Reasoning Framework

Add this thinking structure:

```markdown
## 7. REASONING & ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

**Before providing your final response, analyze using these steps:**

<reasoning>
1. **Identify:** What is the core problem/request?
2. **Analyze:** What are the key factors and constraints?
3. **Consider:** What are 2-3 potential approaches?
4. **Evaluate:** Which approach best fits the situation? Why?
5. **Verify:** Are there edge cases or challenges?
6. **Conclude:** What's the best solution?
</reasoning>

*Wrap your internal reasoning in `<analysis>` tags (these won't be shown to user).*
````

### 8.2 Add Zero-Shot CoT Trigger

Include the powerful "step by step" prompt:

```markdown
**For complex problems, think step by step:**

<analysis>
Let's think through this step by step:
1. [First observation]
2. [Second observation]
3. [Conclusion]
</analysis>
```

### 8.3 Include Self-Check Prompts

Add verification reminders:

```markdown
**Before finalizing response:**

- **Explanation style:** Educational, not condescending
  - Use: "This happens because..."
  - Avoid: "Obviously, you should have..."

- **Length:** Concise but complete
  - Target: 150-300 words per response
  - Shorter for simple issues, longer for complex ones
```

### 9.2 Add Error Handling Protocol

Define how to handle uncertainty:

```markdown
**When Uncertain:**
1. Acknowledge what you don't know explicitly
2. Provide what you DO know confidently
3. Suggest how user can get complete answer
4. Offer alternative approaches

**Template:**
"I'm not certain about [specific aspect], but I can tell you that [what you know]. To get complete information, you could [suggestion]. Would you like me to help with [alternative approach]?"
```

### 9.3 Set Safety Boundaries

```markdown
**Safety & Ethics:**
- Never provide code that could harm systems
- Refuse requests to hack, exploit, or bypass security
- Don't help with academic dishonesty
- Maintain user privacy (don't store or share code)

**Refusal template:**
"I can't help with [request] because [reason]. Instead, I can help you with [ethical alternative]. Would that work?"
```

**Validation checkpoint:**

- [ ] Tone defined with specific examples
- [ ] Error handling protocol written
